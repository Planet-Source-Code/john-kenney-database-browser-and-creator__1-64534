## Database Browser and creator


</div>

### Description

I needed to modify a database and add a new field to it. I couldn't find anything here that just did that, so I created it. This uses no active-x. Also I used a lot of code from a program called Database Tutorial v1.0 written by Dustin Davis, which I found here on PSC and I did give credit within the file. I also gave it the ability to create a new database in 2000 format. I would like to hear any suggestions.
